# Leaderboard DApp

The leaderboard smart contract demonstrates privacy-preserving score tracking on Midnight using the Compact language. This example shows how to create a DApp that lets players submit scores with configurable privacy modes while protecting player identity through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.

The leaderboard example introduces key Midnight concepts:

* Writing smart contracts with structured on-chain data using `Map` and custom structs in Compact
* Using ZK proofs to verify entry ownership without revealing the owner's secret key
* Implementing multiple privacy modes through conditional witness invocation
* Building a browser-based frontend that connects to the Lace wallet

By the end of this guide, you will understand how the leaderboard contract enforces privacy rules and how to build and interact with the full DApp in your browser.

## The leaderboard scenario[​](#the-leaderboard-scenario "Direct link to The leaderboard scenario")

Imagine an arcade leaderboard where players want to record their high scores. The rules are straightforward:

* Anyone can submit a score at any time.
* Each entry stores a score, a display name, and an ownership commitment.
* Players choose how their display name appears: a custom name, their public address, or an anonymous generated name like "Crimson Tiger."
* Only the original submitter can prove ownership of their entry using a ZK proof.

The challenge is enforcing ownership rules while giving players full privacy control. Traditional systems require storing the player's identity on a server. Midnight offers a better approach: players prove ownership locally through ZK proofs without transmitting private data across the network.

## DApp architecture[​](#dapp-architecture "Direct link to DApp architecture")

The leaderboard example uses a monorepo structure with three workspace packages and a Docker configuration for the proof server.

## The leaderboard contract[​](#the-leaderboard-contract "Direct link to The leaderboard contract")

The leaderboard contract is written in Compact. It demonstrates how to build a privacy-preserving application where players can submit scores with configurable display names and prove ownership of their entries without revealing their identity.

Here is the complete contract:

```
pragma language_version 0.23;



import CompactStandardLibrary;



struct ScoreEntry {

  score: Uint<64>,

  displayName: Bytes<32>,

  ownerHash: Bytes<32>

}



export ledger scores: Map<Uint<64>, ScoreEntry>;

export ledger nextId: Counter;



witness localSecretKey(): Bytes<32>;

witness getCustomName(): Bytes<32>;



export circuit ownerCommitment(sk: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32> {

  return persistentHash<Vector<2, Bytes<32>>>([pad(32, "leaderboard:owner:"), sk]);

}



export circuit submitScore(

  score: Uint<64>,

  useCustomName: Boolean

): [] {

  const sk = localSecretKey();

  const ownerHash = ownerCommitment(sk);

  nextId.increment(1);

  const entryId = disclose(nextId.read() as Uint<64>);

  if (disclose(useCustomName)) {

    const customName = getCustomName();

    scores.insert(entryId, ScoreEntry {

      score: disclose(score),

      displayName: disclose(customName),

      ownerHash: disclose(ownerHash)

    });

  } else {

    scores.insert(entryId, ScoreEntry {

      score: disclose(score),

      displayName: disclose(persistentHash<Bytes<32>>(sk)),

      ownerHash: disclose(ownerHash)

    });

  }

}



export circuit verifyOwnership(targetEntryId: Uint<64>): [] {

  assert(scores.member(disclose(targetEntryId)), "entry not found");

  const entry = scores.lookup(disclose(targetEntryId));

  const callerHash = ownerCommitment(localSecretKey());

  assert(callerHash == entry.ownerHash, "not the owner");

}
```

The contract consists of three main components.

### Ledger state[​](#ledger-state "Direct link to Ledger state")

Two public fields track the leaderboard state on-chain:

* `scores`: A `Map<Uint<64>, ScoreEntry>` that stores all submitted entries, keyed by an auto-incrementing ID. Each `ScoreEntry` holds a score, a display name, and an ownership commitment.
* `nextId`: A `Counter` that auto-increments to assign a unique ID to each new entry.

### Circuits[​](#circuits "Direct link to Circuits")

Three exported circuits define the contract's operations:

* `ownerCommitment(sk)`: A helper circuit that derives an on-chain identity from your secret key using `persistentHash`. It produces a deterministic commitment that you can store and verify later without revealing the secret.
* `submitScore(score, useCustomName)`: Creates a new leaderboard entry. It retrieves your secret key via the `localSecretKey` witness, computes the owner commitment, and inserts a new `ScoreEntry` into `scores`. The `useCustomName` flag controls whether the display name comes from the `getCustomName` witness or derives directly from the secret key hash.
* `verifyOwnership(targetEntryId)`: Lets you prove you own a specific entry. It looks up the entry, recomputes the owner commitment from your secret key, and asserts that it matches the stored `ownerHash`. Nothing is written to the ledger.

### Witnesses[​](#witnesses "Direct link to Witnesses")

The contract defines two witness functions:

* `localSecretKey()`: Returns your secret key from private state. The key never appears on-chain or in any generated proof.
* `getCustomName()`: Returns a custom display name that the TypeScript host provides at runtime. The TypeScript layer decides what value to supply based on your selected privacy mode.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before working with the leaderboard example, ensure that you have:

* Node.js version 22 or higher
* Docker Desktop installed and running
* Compact toolchain installed
* Lace wallet browser extension installed

For more information, refer to [install the toolchain](/getting-started/installation.md).

## Set up the example[​](#set-up-the-example "Direct link to Set up the example")

### Clone the repository[​](#clone-the-repository "Direct link to Clone the repository")

Get the leaderboard example from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-leaderboard.git

cd midnight-leaderboard
```

### Install dependencies[​](#install-dependencies "Direct link to Install dependencies")

Install all required Node.js packages:

```
npm install
```

This command installs packages for the contract, API, and UI components.

## Start the proof server[​](#start-the-proof-server "Direct link to Start the proof server")

The proof server generates ZK proofs for transactions locally to protect private data. It must be running before you can deploy or interact with contracts.

Start the proof server:

```
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3 -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

Keep the proof server running

The proof server must stay active while using the DApp.

## Compile the contract[​](#compile-the-contract "Direct link to Compile the contract")

Open a new terminal window at the project root and navigate to the `contract` directory:

```
cd contract

npm run compact
```

This command compiles the contract and generates TypeScript bindings, circuit keys, and ZKIR files in `contract/managed/leaderboard/`.

You should see the following output:

```
Compiling 2 circuits:

  circuit "submitScore" (k=13, rows=4720)

  circuit "verifyOwnership" (k=13, rows=2352)
```

Build the contract and API packages:

```
cd ..

npm run build
```

## Set up the wallet[​](#set-up-the-wallet "Direct link to Set up the wallet")

The browser DApp connects to the Lace wallet for on-chain transactions.

1. Install the [Lace](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace/gafhhkghbfjjkeiendhlofajokpaflmk) browser extension and create a new wallet.
2. Set the network to **Preprod**.
3. Set the proof server to `http://localhost:6300`.
4. Fund your wallet with tNIGHT from the [Preprod faucet](https://midnight-tmnight-preprod.nethermind.dev/).
5. Go to Tokens, click **Generate tDUST**, and confirm the transaction.

About tDUST

You need tDUST to pay transaction fees on Preprod. The wallet generates tDUST from your tNIGHT balance.

## Run the browser DApp[​](#run-the-browser-dapp "Direct link to Run the browser DApp")

Navigate to the `leaderboard-ui` directory, install dependencies, and start the development server:

```
cd leaderboard-ui

npm install

npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The leaderboard UI loads and connects to the Preprod indexer.

## Interact with the leaderboard[​](#interact-with-the-leaderboard "Direct link to Interact with the leaderboard")

### Connect your wallet[​](#connect-your-wallet "Direct link to Connect your wallet")

Click **Connect Wallet** in the top-right corner of the UI. Lace prompts you to authorize the connection. After you approve, your wallet address and tDUST balance appear in the header.

### Deploy a new contract[​](#deploy-a-new-contract "Direct link to Deploy a new contract")

Click **Deploy Contract**. The UI calls `LeaderboardAPI.deploy()`, which submits a deployment transaction through Lace. Wait for the transaction to confirm on Preprod.

Transaction time

Contract deployment typically takes 20 to 30 seconds on Preprod as the network processes your transaction and ZK proofs.

After confirmation, the contract address appears in the UI.

### Submit a score[​](#submit-a-score "Direct link to Submit a score")

The game area displays a score counter. Play the game or enter a score manually, then choose a display name mode before submitting:

* **Custom name**: Enter a name up to 32 characters. The `getCustomName` witness supplies this value to the circuit.
* **Public address**: The `getCustomName` witness passes your wallet address as the display name.
* **Anonymous**: The contract does not invoke the `getCustomName` witness. Instead, the circuit stores `persistentHash(secretKey)` as the display name. The `localSecretKey` witness is still called to compute the owner commitment. The UI renders anonymous entries as generated names like "Crimson Tiger."

Click **Submit Score**. The UI:

1. Retrieves your secret key from private state via the `localSecretKey` witness.
2. Computes your owner commitment using `ownerCommitment(secretKey)`.
3. Generates a ZK proof locally via the proof server.
4. Submits the transaction through Lace.
5. Waits for confirmation and refreshes the leaderboard.

Privacy protection

Your secret key never leaves your machine. The proof server generates the ZK proof locally before anything is sent to the network.

### View the leaderboard[​](#view-the-leaderboard "Direct link to View the leaderboard")

The leaderboard table updates automatically after each confirmed transaction. It reads state directly from the Preprod indexer without requiring a wallet connection. Anonymous entries appear with generated names. Custom and public-address entries appear as submitted.

### Verify entry ownership[​](#verify-entry-ownership "Direct link to Verify entry ownership")

Click **Verify Ownership** next to any of your entries. The UI calls `verifyOwnership(entryId)`, which generates a ZK proof that your secret key matches the `ownerHash` stored in the entry. The circuit asserts the match on-chain without writing anything to the ledger.

A success message confirms ownership. If your wallet does not hold the correct secret key for that entry, the assertion fails and the proof server rejects the transaction locally before it reaches the network.

Same browser required

Ownership verification only works from the same browser and wallet instance that submitted the entry, because the secret key lives in the local private state store.

### Read state without a wallet[​](#read-state-without-a-wallet "Direct link to Read state without a wallet")

You can view the leaderboard without connecting a wallet. The UI fetches the `scores` map directly from the indexer using the `LeaderboardIndexerProvider`. This is read-only access. Score submission and ownership verification require a wallet connection.

## Next steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")

Now that you understand the leaderboard example:

* **Explore the GitHub repository**: [Leaderboard repository](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-leaderboard)
