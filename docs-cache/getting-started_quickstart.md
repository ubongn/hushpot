# Create a Midnight DApp

This guide explains how to scaffold a Midnight DApp using the `create-mn-app` CLI tool.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

The following tools are required to run a Midnight DApp:

* Compact compiler installed. See [install the toolchain](/getting-started/installation.md) for instructions.
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running, with Docker Compose v2.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 22+ installed. You can use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js.

## Midnight CLI tool[​](#midnight-cli-tool "Direct link to Midnight CLI tool")

The [`create-mn-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mn-app) CLI tool provides starter templates for Midnight DApps. It includes a preconfigured TypeScript setup, hot reloading, and wallet operation logic.

To scaffold a new DApp, run the following command:

```
npx create-mn-app [project-name]
```

info

Ensure you replace `[project-name]` with the name of your new DApp.

The CLI tool first prompts you to choose the type of project you want to create:

* Contract
* Full DApp

If you are new to Midnight development, then starting with *contract* is recommended. It provides a minimal setup that focuses on compiling and deploying a Compact smart contract before working with a full application scaffold.

#### Contract[​](#contract "Direct link to Contract")

Selecting **Contract** scaffolds a minimal project for deploying a Compact smart contract. You are then prompted to choose a contract template:

| Template      | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hello-world` | Default. A message-storage contract bundled with a local devnet for compiling, deploying, and interacting with a Compact contract. |
| `battleship`  | A private-board state machine, cloned from [example-battleship](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-battleship).              |

Only `hello-world` ships the bundled devnet and the `--network` flag.

#### Full DApp[​](#full-dapp "Direct link to Full DApp")

Selecting **Full DApp** scaffolds a complete decentralized application with a browser-based or CLI interface for interacting with the contract. You are then prompted to choose a DApp template:

| Template      | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bboard`      | Default. A privacy-preserving bulletin board, cloned from [example-bboard](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard).                       |
| `leaderboard` | A React + Lace browser DApp with in-browser ZK proving, cloned from [midnight-leaderboard](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-leaderboard). |

note

`dex` and `midnight-kitties` appear as *coming soon* in the template picker. Full DApp templates follow their upstream repository's README rather than the bundled devnet flow described below.

For this guide, select **Contract** at the first prompt and then choose **hello-world** at the template selection prompt. Follow the remaining prompts to complete the setup.

```
Creating a new Midnight app in /path/to/my-app.



Template: hello-world



✔ Project structure created

✔ Dependencies installed

✔ Git repository initialized

✔ Docker is ready for proof server

✔ Contract compiled successfully



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎉 Success! Your Midnight app is ready.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Once the installation is complete, navigate to the `my-app` directory:

```
cd my-app
```

Your project structure should look similar to this:

```
my-app/

├── contracts/

│   └── hello-world.compact    # Compact smart contract

├── src/

│   ├── cli.ts                 # Interact with deployed contract

│   ├── deploy.ts              # Deploy contract

│   └── check-balance.ts       # Check wallet balance

├── docker-compose.yml         # Local devnet: node, indexer, proof server

├── package.json

└── .midnight-state.json       # Deployment state (gitignored; contract address and network)
```

The `contracts/hello-world.compact` file contains the Compact smart contract code.

```
pragma language_version >= 0.23;



import CompactStandardLibrary;



export ledger message: Opaque<"string">;



export circuit storeMessage(customMessage: Opaque<"string">): [] {

    message = disclose(customMessage);

}
```

[Compact](/compact.md) is Midnight's smart contract language used to define contract logic. It is similar to TypeScript but is designed for use with the Midnight runtime.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines a local devnet, a Midnight node, indexer, and [proof server](/guides/run-proof-server.md) that runs in Docker. The proof server generates Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs for smart contracts on the Midnight network. The devnet must be running before you can deploy or interact with the contract.

## Set up the project[​](#set-up-the-project "Direct link to Set up the project")

Run the setup script:

```
npm run setup
```

`npm run setup` boots a local devnet in Docker (node, indexer, and proof server), compiles the contract, and deploys it. You don't need a wallet extension or a faucet — the local `dev` preset pre-mints NIGHT to a genesis seed, which funds the deployment automatically.

The CLI writes deployment state to `.midnight-state.json` (Git ignores this file), which holds the contract address and the active network. The CLI references this file when interacting with the contract.

## Interact with the contract[​](#interact-with-the-contract "Direct link to Interact with the contract")

After you deploy the contract, start the interactive CLI:

```
npm run cli
```

The CLI lets you interact with the deployed contract:

```
1. Store a message

2. Read current message

3. Check wallet balance

4. Exit
```

Choose an option from the menu and follow the prompts. To read the ledger state directly, run the end-to-end test:

```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Deploy to a public testnet[​](#deploy-to-a-public-testnet "Direct link to Deploy to a public testnet")

The local devnet is the default. Public testnets are opt-in, pass `--network` to `npm run setup`:

```
npm run setup -- --network preview
```

The first time you target a public network, the CLI generates a wallet and prints a faucet URL to fund it. Open the [preview faucet](https://midnight-tmnight-preview.nethermind.dev/) or [preprod faucet](https://midnight-tmnight-preprod.nethermind.dev/) to fund the wallet. The network selection is sticky; switch networks later with `npm run network <name>`.

| Network      | Source                                                                      | When to use                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `undeployed` | Local devnet (`docker-compose.yml`)                                         | Default. No funding or wallet extension required. |
| `preview`    | Public preview ([faucet](https://midnight-tmnight-preview.nethermind.dev/)) | Shared infrastructure before a release.           |
| `preprod`    | Public preprod ([faucet](https://midnight-tmnight-preprod.nethermind.dev/)) | Closest to mainnet.                               |

## Templates[​](#templates "Direct link to Templates")

The Midnight CLI tool provides starter templates for both contracts and full DApps. Pass a template with `--template <name>`, or omit it and the CLI prompts you to choose.

### Hello world[​](#hello-world "Direct link to Hello world")

The `hello-world` template is a message storage contract that allows you to post and retrieve messages on the blockchain. It ships with the bundled local devnet.

```
npx create-mn-app my-app
```

`hello-world` is the default and comes with dependencies installed. You don't need the `--template` flag to create a new `hello-world` project.

### Battleship[​](#battleship "Direct link to Battleship")

The `battleship` template is a private-board state machine, cloned from [example-battleship](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-battleship).

```
npx create-mn-app my-app --template battleship
```

### Bulletin board[​](#bulletin-board "Direct link to Bulletin board")

The `bboard` template is a privacy-preserving bulletin board DApp that allows you to post and remove messages, cloned from [example-bboard](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard).

```
npx create-mn-app my-app --template bboard
```

This template uses ZK proofs to verify the identity of the poster and the owner of the message without revealing their identity on-chain. To learn more about the Bulletin board DApp, see the [Bulletin board DApp](/examples/dapps/bboard.md) example.

### Leaderboard[​](#leaderboard "Direct link to Leaderboard")

The `leaderboard` template is a React + Lace browser DApp with in-browser ZK proving, cloned from [midnight-leaderboard](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-leaderboard).

```
npx create-mn-app my-app --template leaderboard
```

note

`create-mn-app` v0.4.2 removed the Counter template. You can still scaffold the retired Counter example with the `--from` flag:

```
npx create-mn-app@latest my-app --from midnightntwrk/example-counter
```

## CLI options[​](#cli-options "Direct link to CLI options")

The following options are available when creating a new DApp using the `create-mn-app` CLI tool:

| Option                    | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-t`, `--template <name>` | Select a template: `hello-world`, `battleship`, `bboard`, `leaderboard`             |
| `--list`                  | List the available templates                                                        |
| `--from <owner/repo>`     | Scaffold from a GitHub repository                                                   |
| `--network <name>`        | Set the network for the `hello-world` template (`undeployed`, `preview`, `preprod`) |
| `-y`                      | Accept defaults without prompting                                                   |
| `--dry-run`               | Show what the CLI would create without writing files                                |
| `--use-npm/yarn/pnpm/bun` | Force the use of a specific package manager                                         |
| `--skip-install`          | Skip the installation of dependencies                                               |
| `--skip-git`              | Skip the initialization of a git repository                                         |
| `--verbose`               | Show detailed output when creating the project                                      |
| `-h`, `--help`            | Show help                                                                           |
| `-V`, `--version`         | Show the version of the CLI tool                                                    |
